  //Remember, you're returning exponent - 1 as the value of exponent when its called.
  //Also remember that knowing the value of the base case why this logically makes any sense.
  //Logic: Pass in 2, 3 to power function. Well 2^3 is equal to 2 * 2^2 and so on. Each iteration of this is added to stack until you hit the base case.
  //Once the base condition is met, recurse back up while popping each successfully executed call off the top of the stack.
