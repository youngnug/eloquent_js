  //You pass in 3, so the if statement is false, go to else. Then 2 * power(2,3-1) is called. That function call immediately loops us back to the top at the definition
  //Same process repeateds until 0, this satisfies the return 1 statement.
  //Once 1 is returned, the stack of calls depicted to the right above have the answer they were waiting on. power(2,0) == 1
  //Logic: Pass in 2, 3 to power function. Well 2^3 is equal to 2 * 2^(2-1) and so on. Each iteration of this is added to stack until you hit the base case.
